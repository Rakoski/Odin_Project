/* Inheritance refers to certain CSS properties that, when applied to an element, 
are inherited by that element’s descendants, even if we don’t explicitly write a rule for those descendants. 
Typography based properties (color, font-size, font-family, etc.) 
are usually inherited, while most other properties aren’t. */

#parent {
    color: red;
  }
  
  .child {
    color: blue;
  }

  /* Rule Order
  The final factor, the end of the line, the tie-breaker of the tie-breaker.
   Let’s say that after every other factor has been taken into account, 
  there are still multiple conflicting rules targeting an element. 
  /* How does the cascade determine which rule to apply? */

  /* Really simply, actually. Whichever rule was the last defined is the winner. */ 

.alert {
    color: red;
  }
  
  .warning {
    color: yellow;
  }

  /* For an element that has both the alert and warning classes, the cascade would run through every other factor, 
  including inheritance (none here) and specificity (neither rule is more specific than the other). 
  Since the .warning rule was the last one defined, and no other factor was able to determine which rule to apply, 
  it’s the one that gets applied to the element. */
